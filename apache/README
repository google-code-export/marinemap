To deploy a project under mod_wsgi, you need a script to act as the wsgi handler and some apache directives

Create a copy of these files in the project's src tree and modify 
* the project_wsgi.py script to point to the proper paths
* the project_apache.conf file paths

Include the project's apache .conf in httpd.conf (or symlink to sites-available directory and a2enable it)
