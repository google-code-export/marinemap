The easiest of those three that you can change is your browser. On Windows, <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/\">Mozilla Firefox</a> and <a href=\"http://www.google.com/chrome/index.html\">Google Chrome</a> are both excellent choices. While Internet Explorer is supported, it is not a very good performer for web applications like MarineMap.
