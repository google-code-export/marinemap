<h3>Graticule Clipping</h3>
<p>Your geometry has been clipped to match the given graticule(s). Portions not contained within the graticule(s) have been removed.</p>
<br />
<p>If this is not the outcome you wanted, try to refine your selection to better fit the habitat you are trying to capture. Turning on the Graticule layer from the Data Layers menu can help you in this process.</p>
