<h3>No Graticule Overlap</h3>
<p>The graticules you defined do not correspond with the target shape.  No change was made to the original shape</p>
<p>If this is not the outcome you wanted, try to refine your selection to better fit the habitat you are trying to capture. Turning on the Graticule layer from the Data Layers menu can help you in this process.</p>
