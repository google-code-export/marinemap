Tickets in the bug tracker can be labelled a Priority, but it's a little ambiguous what priority means. For a little more clarity, lets use the [MoSCoW](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_Method) Method.

  * M - **MUST** have this. == **Critical**
  * S - **SHOULD** have this if at all possible. == **High**
  * C - **COULD** have this if it does not affect anything else. == **Medium**
  * W - **WON'T** have this time but WOULD like in the future. == **Low**
