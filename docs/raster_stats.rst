`lingcod.raster_stats`: Raster Statistics
=========================================
The `lingcod.raster_stats` app allows you to analyze raster datasets based on a polygon geometry. For example, for a given polygon, you may want to know the average elevation or the maximum temperature, etc. Essentially this performs a vector-on-raster intersection. 

The app uses an optional caching mechanism so that any geometry/raster combination only needs to be run once. 

The raster_stats app provides a model to register raster datasets, a utility function to quickly calculate stats programatically and a webservice which returns the statistics in json format.

Installation
------------
The raster_stats app relies on the `starspan` executable. This C++ app must be installed from src and requires GDAL and GEOS header files::

    wget http://marinemap.googlecode.com/files/starspan-1.2.05.tar.gz
    tar -xzvf starspan-1.2.05.tar.gz
    cd starspan-1.2.05
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

Settings
--------
optionally set the `STARSPAN_BIN` setting to point to your starspan executable and the `RASTER_DIR` setting for the filepath to the directory containing your raster files.

Then just add to your installed apps::

    INSTALLED_APPS += ( 'lingcod.raster_stats' )

Adding a Raster
---------------
Simple as it gets. Type is used to define the raster as `continuous` (e.g. elevation)::
    
    from lingcod.raster_stats.models import RasterDataset
    elev = RasterDataset.objects.create(name="test_elevation",filepath='/tmp/data/elevation.tif',type='continuous')  

or discrete categorical values (e.g. land use)::

    land = RasterDataset.objects.create(name="landuse",filepath='/tmp/data/landuse.tif',type='categorical')  

Running zonal stats
-------------------
Use the utility function which will first check the cache. If nothing is in the cache, the full starspan analysis is run. Otherwise the cache hit is returned::

    from lingcod.raster_stats.models import zonal_stats
    stats = zonal_stats(geos_polygon_geom, elev)
    stats.from_cache # False
    
    stats = zonal_stats(geos_polygon_geom, elev)
    stats.from_cache # True
    stats.min 
    stats.max
    stats.median
    stats.mode
    stats.nulls
    stats.pixels
    stats.avg
    stats.stdev


Categorical rasters
-------------------
In addition to the zonal statistics calculated for a continuous raster, categorical rasters can access the pixel counts for each discrete category of raster values::

    stats = zonal_stats(geos_polygon_geom, landuse)
    total_pixels = stats.pixels
    stats.categories.all() # returns a queryset of ZonalCategories
    for cat in stats.categories.all():
        print "Category", cat.category, "has", cat.count, "pixels out of a total of", total_pixels
        # ex: "Category 42 has 1866 pixels out of a total of 7866"

It is the programmers responsibility to account for mapping the category raster code to a meaningful category name (i.e. 42 == 'Douglas Fir') as well as handling any null cells that might affect the total pixel count; check `stats.nulls` and adjust accordingly. For example if stats.pixels == 7866 and stats.nulls == 1000, you may consider the total pixel count to be 6866 depending on your analysis needs.

Specifying the pixel proportion
-------------------------------
Starspan allows you to define the threshold of cell inclusion based on the percentage of the pixel that is covered by the polygon. By default, a raster cell is included if the geometry overlaps >= 50% of the cell. You can adjust this value by assigning an alternate `pixprop` value between 0 and 1::

    stats = zonal_stats(geos_polygon_geom, landuse, pixprop=0.85) # cell must be 85% covered to be included

Using the web service
---------------------
The app provides a urls.py file; just point your main URLCONF file to it::

    (r'^zonal/', include('lingcod.raster_stats.urls')),

You can get a json list of the rasters at this url::

	http://localhost/zonal/

And you can append the raster name and supply a `geom_txt` parameter (either wkt or json) which returns the rasters stats as json::

	http://localhost/zonal/sst/?geom_txt=POLYGON ((-122.735420504497029 37.238868044757552,-122.516579972608298 37.245550198403009,-122.50822728055148 37.043415050627928,-122.730408889262932 37.046756127450656,-122.735420504497029 37.238868044757552))
