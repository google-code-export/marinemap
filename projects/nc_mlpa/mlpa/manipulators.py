        required argument:

        optional arguments:
            generally USED FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY
            estuaries, a GEOSGeometry of the shape to be clipped, in srid GEOMETRY_CLIENT_SRID (4326) 
        concerning **kwargs:
            kwargs is included to prevent errors resulting from extra arguments being passed to this manipulator from the generic view
        manipulate() return value:
            a dictionary containing the 'clipped_shape', and the 'orginal_shape', and optional 'message' and 'html' values
            all of the returned shape geometries will be in srid GEOMETRY_CLIENT_SRID (4326) 
            in the case where there is estuary overlap, the largest poly (oceanic or estuary) is returned 
            otherwise, the original target_shape geometry is returned un-modified as 'clipped_shape'
        
        html_templates==9   This represents an 'internal error' and is accessed by raising a ManipulatorInternalException
                            This should occur under the following circumstances:
                                if Estuaries not found in database
                                or geometry manipulations failed
                            clipped_shape will be returned as None
        html_templates==3   This represents an 'user error' and is accessed by raising a InvalidGeometryException
                            This should occur under the following circumstances:
                                if geometry can not be generated from target_shape 
                                or if target_shape is not a valid geometry
                            clipped_shape will be returned as None      
        html_templates==4   if target_shape is estuary only    
        html_templates==2   if target_shape is split between estuary and oceanic
        html_templates==0   if there is no overlap with estuary found
        
        no template returned when Estuaries is empty
        in this case, clipped_shape will be returned as target_shape
