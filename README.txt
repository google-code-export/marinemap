MarineMap is a web-based decision support tool for open and participatory spatial 
planning in the marine environment. MarineMap offers a simple, flexible and powerful
means of gathering expertise from resource managers, scientists, stakeholders and 
public in a process of collaborative decision making.

MarineMap is developed as a set of reusable apps for the django web framework. 
The components are bundled into a python module called 'lingcod'. Using lingcod, 
one can create their own implementation of MarineMap or extend the tools for any
sort of collaborative spatial planning process.
