<h3>Your Geometry Is Both Eastern and Western</h3>
<p>An MPA geometry can either fall entirely within the eastern or western half, or it can overlap them both. In cases like this where a geometry overlaps both and is not entirely within either half, the system creates two polygons. Whichever is larger is the one it assumes you would like to create.</p>
<p>In this case, the system chose the <b>Eastern Part</b></p>
